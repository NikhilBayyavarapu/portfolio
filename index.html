										<h3>Cluster Detection in Graphs</h3>
										<p>Used Girvan Newman Algorithm to find clusters in a given data set. Edge betweenness is
											used to identify edges that are to be removed from the graph to form clusters. Identifying the clusters is an
											essential aspect of Graph Theory.</p>

										<h3>Matching Cut Problem in Graphs</h3>
										<p>This is a Non-Deterministic Polynomial Time problem. I implemented an Algorithm to verify its correctness.
											The algorithm had many parameters that we can play with. I tuned to find the optimal ones to get a matching cut.</p>

										<h3>Campus Energy Monitoring System</h3>
										<p>An energy monitoring kit consisting of PZEM-004T(monitors current, voltage and power) module and
											ESP8266(Wi-Fi) module was built. This kit was then installed at various parts of our campus
											. The obtained electricity consumption data was then uploaded to a server where we analysed data over various time
											periods</p>

										<h3>Hostel Room Management System</h3>
										<p> The primary objective of this project was to address the challenges associated with Hostel Room Management on our campus. Previously, tasks such as room allocation, vacation management, and housekeeping services were handled manually, relying on book records. To streamline and automate these processes, we developed a web application using the waterfall approach. We documented detailed information about the software requirements, software design, and software architecture to guide the development process.
											 By implementing this solution, we successfully eliminated the laborious manual tasks that were previously undertaken by the Hostel Management team.</p>

										<h3>IMDb Database</h3>
										<p> This project provided us with insights into real-world data organization techniques for optimal performance in applications.
											A database schema was designed from scratch using ER diagrams and then populated with real-world IMDb datasets. To enhance the data retrieval process, Stored Procedures and Functions were created to facilitate filtering and retrieval of specific information. In order to improve query performance, optimizations were made and indexes were added strategically.
											 These measures aimed at achieving better overall system performance and efficiency.</p>

										<h3>MATLAB Licensing Webservice</h3>
										<p>
											As a key contributor to the Cloud Platforms Integration Team, I played a vital role in the development of the MATLAB Batch Licensing Webservice.
												My primary focus was on the authentication aspect of the service, which involves MATLAB Batch Tokens.
												I successfully designed the database schema and implemented the backend infrastructure for secure storage and validation of tokens.
												The result was a powerful webservice that empowers end users with greater control over their product experience.
												Our efficient approach allowed a small team of three members to successfully handle all administrative and management tasks for the MATLAB Licensing Webservice.

										<h3>Server DataStore Support for Widgets in MATLAB</h3>
										<p>
											This project leverages the capabilities of MATLAB widgets to visualize and display data on the client side. However, certain resource-intensive operations cannot be efficiently performed on the client.

											To overcome this limitation, the project introduces a Server DataStore. The heavy computational tasks will be performed on the server. The processed information will then be transmitted back to the client for rendering and presentation using the widget.
 											This approach ensures that the client's resources are not overloaded and allows for seamless data visualization.
